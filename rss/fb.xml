Some pro-choice arguments, like the one in this example, attempt to show that abortion is okay *even if* a fetus has human rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many differences between abortion and refraining from donating an organ, but one of the most important differences is this. When a patient waiting for an organ transplant dies, *her injury or illness* is what kills her. If you could have donated the organ and didn’t, you allowed her to die, but you didn’t kill her. To be clear, this tragic situation is very serious, and we should all carefully consider whether we are doing enough to assist those in need. However, declining to donate organs is not homicide. In contrast, when a fetus dies through elective abortion, *the act of abortion itself* is what kills her. Abortion is a violation of basic human rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out this related blog post by Pro-Life Humanists: http://www.prolifehumanists.org/unwanted-pregnancy-forced-organ-donation/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/abortion-vs-not-donating-organs/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_bodilyautonomy #WMPLL_ethics</description></item><item><title>Take Pro-Choice Ideas Seriously</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/take-pro-choice-ideas-seriously/</link><guid>d0da0742-c440-4431-8b24-663b3ce5c5ce</guid><pubDate>2019-06-08</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/take-pro-choice-ideas-seriously/take-pro-choice-ideas-seriously-0-940.png"&gt;Pro-choice people are our peers. Ultimately, we think the best arguments and evidence support the pro-life position, but you should take pro-choice arguments seriously. People defending abortion deserve genuine responses to the things they say. If we all try to understand each other, we’ll be in a better position to reach a consensus about abortion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/take-pro-choice-ideas-seriously/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_buildeachotherup</description></item><item><title>Push Forward to a Pro-Life Future</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/push-forward-to-a-pro-life-future/</link><guid>d95d4b3e-2972-418c-8579-3642a39a4f0c</guid><pubDate>2019-06-01</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/push-forward-to-a-pro-life-future/push-forward-to-a-pro-life-future-0-940.png"&gt;Unfortunately, people were treated badly in the past, and people are still treated badly today.

Build common ground with your conversation partner by showing that you care about pregnant women too. As pro-life advocates, we think society should use nonviolent methods to support pregnant women. If you make that clear, your conversation partner will be more likely to take your anti-abortion stance seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/women-get-abortions-for-real-reasons/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_empathy</description></item></channel>
