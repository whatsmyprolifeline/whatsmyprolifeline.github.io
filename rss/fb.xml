Thankfully, people with disabilities can live happy lives and enrich the lives of those around them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the U.S., the majority of fetuses diagnosed with Down syndrome are killed through abortion. This practice is sometimes described as “eliminating Down syndrome,” but in reality, it eliminates people with Down syndrome. When a woman is pregnant, a new person has already come into the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you make an analogy between abortion and killing a two-year-old, don’t expect the analogy to change anyone’s mind on its own. Pro-choice people usually think that there’s an important difference between abortion and killing a two-year-old. The point of the analogy is just to bring those differences to the surface. Listen very carefully as they explain what they think is the crucial difference between abortion and killing a two-year-old, and go from there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They might point to something about the fetus herself. They might think abortion is similar to killing a plant or removing a tumor. In reality, abortion kills a living human person who deserves basic rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of the fetus herself, they might point to something about the situation the fetus and mother are in. They might think abortion is similar to unplugging a ventilator or defending yourself against an assailant. It’s true that pregnancy is a unique and challenging situation, but abortion is nevertheless an unjustified act of violence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rarely, someone might bite the bullet and say to kill the two-year-old. In this case, we recommend that you drop the abortion topic until you can reach agreement about killing two-year-olds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/disabled-people-matter/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_TOT #WMPLL_ethics</description></item><item><title>Teen Dad’s Dad</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/teen-dads-dad/</link><guid>ee8c36d1-18bf-44b2-b1ac-c3612e9e5897</guid><pubDate>2020-10-18</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/teen-dads-dad/teen-dads-dad-0-fb.png"&gt;Unfortunately, many teenagers get abortions without involving their parents in the decision at all. If your child tells you they’ve conceived a child of their own, it’s natural to feel a lot of emotions. Try to be grateful for the opportunity to be a supportive parent and grandparent. At this point, it’s not a good time to talk about the choices that led to the pregnancy. Focus on making the best of the situation. No matter the circumstances, a new baby can be a source of joy and excitement!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/teen-dads-dad/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_society</description></item><item><title>Separation of Church and State</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/separation-of-church-and-state/</link><guid>a3451989-2d91-4c80-ad6d-1d2ea7952e63</guid><pubDate>2020-10-15</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/separation-of-church-and-state/separation-of-church-and-state-0-fb.png"&gt;In our experience, pro-choice people — whether religious or not — often find non-religious pro-life arguments more persuasive than religious pro-life arguments. Religious beliefs might inform your stance on abortion, but religion isn’t the only reason to oppose abortion. The same is true of other injustices such as infanticide, racism, or sexual assault.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s fine to have religious discussions about abortion when that’s what both parties want, but you should also be prepared to talk with someone who would be more comfortable leaving religion out of the conversation. Check out non-religious pro-life groups like Secular Pro-Life and Pro-Life Humanists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/separation-of-church-and-state/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_religion #WMPLL_politics</description></item><item><title>Bringing a Child Into the World</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/bringing-child-into-world/</link><guid>88224529-d89a-45ff-84f8-51aad8076bf1</guid><pubDate>2020-10-12</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/bringing-child-into-world/bringing-child-into-world-0-fb.png"&gt;It’s okay not to feel ready to be a parent. Make it clear to your conversation partner that you don’t think an unprepared pregnant woman should just be left to fend for herself. Society should use nonviolent methods to support pregnant women. For example, we’re grateful for the adoption system. Placing a baby for adoption can be a great act of love toward that baby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fertilization brings a kid into the world; abortion kills a kid who is already alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/bringing-child-into-world/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_lifebegins #WMPLL_personhood #WMPLL_society</description></item><item><title>Glad You’re Okay</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/glad-youre-okay/</link><guid>bb2a4f2d-aca8-4745-96e7-75938a0ee865</guid><pubDate>2020-07-15</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/glad-youre-okay/glad-youre-okay-1-fb.png"&gt;It’s not always time to make a pro-life argument. Remember to show compassion and listen to understand. Abortion is a really sensitive topic! Be prepared for any conversation to emotionally affect people, and understand that if someone is upset, they’re not prepared to think reasonably. They will probably reject any argument you make, and even view arguments as personal attacks. We don’t want to upset people, so when you’re talking with someone who may be emotionally affected by the conversation, it’s a good idea to spend a lot of time building trust and common ground. You may not even get to make a single argument in your first few conversations with someone! That’s okay. You’re still making positive progress even if all you’re doing is moving toward an environment where your conversation partner feels safe enough to think about what you’re saying with an open mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/glad-youre-okay/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_empathy</description></item><item><title>Men and Women Make Mistakes</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/men-and-women-make-mistakes/</link><guid>3e249011-c52f-48b7-b5c6-708494487e63</guid><pubDate>2020-07-12</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/men-and-women-make-mistakes/men-and-women-make-mistakes-0-fb.png"&gt;Being accused of mistrusting women can hurt. Try not to take personal offense. Faced with that accusation, well-meaning pro-lifers might be tempted to say something like, “It’s not about women, it’s about taking care of the baby.” The truth is, it’s about both. Defending the child of an abortion-minded woman means preventing her from making a particular choice. That’s okay! “To err is human” after all. We all need help sometimes making right choices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your pro-choice conversation partner probably recognizes the goodness of stopping someone from doing something horrendous. We think child abuse is a good example. Thankfully, there is widespread agreement that child abuse is never okay. As pro-lifers, we understand that the fetus is a small child, and ending their life is an extreme form of abuse, even if those involved have good intentions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don’t expect their mind to change immediately. Pro-choice people usually feel that there’s some important difference between abortion and child abuse. Hopefully, they’ll respond by expressing more clearly what they disagree with you about. Do they think the fetus isn’t a child? In that case, it’s time to for a conversation about human biology and human value. Or maybe they think abortion doesn’t count as abuse. Then the two of you should discuss the ethics of violence and killing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/men-and-women-make-mistakes/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_ethics #WMPLL_womenshealth #WMPLL_bodilyautonomy #WMPLL_society</description></item><item><title>Diverse People Deserve the Same Rights</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/diverse-people-deserve-the-same-rights/</link><guid>37f35f51-e466-4c73-9adb-83d31d212ec8</guid><pubDate>2020-06-07</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/diverse-people-deserve-the-same-rights/diverse-people-deserve-the-same-rights-1-fb.png"&gt;This is called the Equal Rights Argument. On all sides of the abortion debate, most people agree that those of us outside the womb have equal value. We think a good explanation for this equality is that we’re all members of the human species. The human fetus is also a member of the human species, so the fetus is a person with that same value. Most popular alternative explanations have troubling, unpopular implications.

The pro-life and pro-choice communities are both diverse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Share your pro-life convictions with those around you. Be confident but not intimidating. Make it clear that you’re a safe person to talk to. Invite people into respectful abortion dialogue, but don’t force it or make them feel flustered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/if-theyre-surprised-youre-pro-life/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_society #WMPLL_buildeachotherup</description></item><item><title>We Know When Life Begins</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/we-know-when-life-begins/</link><guid>2d107686-1c19-4927-86af-1c28a12b5a8e</guid><pubDate>2020-01-03</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/we-know-when-life-begins/we-know-when-life-begins-1-fb.png"&gt;This is an important clarification question. Some well-meaning pro-life advocates only focus on the fact that a fetus is biologically alive, but that’s not always helpful. Sometimes people say “life” to mean “the life of a person”, and we need to be prepared to give an argument that every member of the human species is a valuable person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/we-know-when-life-begins/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_lifebegins #WMPLL_biology #WMPLL_personhood</description></item><item><title>Who Will Adopt Unwanted Babies?</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/who-will-adopt-unwanted-babies/</link><guid>a462e653-3b1f-4d22-9e43-c0f023009063</guid><pubDate>2019-12-29</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/who-will-adopt-unwanted-babies/who-will-adopt-unwanted-babies-0-fb.png"&gt;We should all want kids to grow up in happy homes. Unfortunately, there really are a lot of *older* kids in the foster care system, many of whom are waiting to be adopted. These kids do face serious challenges. On the other hand, when *newborns* are placed for adoption, they go directly to adoptive families’ homes, generally without even entering the foster care system at all. Gently make sure your conversation partner understands the differences between these two situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/who-will-adopt-unwanted-babies/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_society</description></item></channel>
