Make it clear that this isn’t about punishing or oppressing women. We think men and women have equal value. We also think fetuses and adults have equal value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/should-we-tell-women-what-to-do/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_politics #WMPLL_society</description></item><item><title>Let’s at Least Understand Each Other</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/lets-understand-each-other/</link><guid>2833db00-9951-487a-8ce3-cbe779b7fafa</guid><pubDate>2019-12-07</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/lets-understand-each-other/lets-understand-each-other-0-fb.png"&gt;We do want pro-choice people’s minds to change about abortion. (We want to establish a pro-life consensus!) But sometimes, someone just isn’t ready to change their mind. In that case, it’s good to at least learn about their views and help them to learn about ours. That way, we can strengthen our relationship with them, we can become better pro-life advocates, and we can give them a better impression of the pro-life movement. If we’re lucky, maybe their mind will change after all, or at least we’ll be in a better position to change their mind in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, if someone really doesn’t want to talk about abortion, don’t force it. You might end up doing more harm than good if you’re too pushy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/lets-understand-each-other/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_empathy</description></item><item><title>An Individual Life vs. Life in General</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/individual-vs-general-life/</link><guid>b6f14cc2-31f8-4117-aec2-0a605361b14a</guid><pubDate>2019-11-27</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/individual-vs-general-life/individual-vs-general-life-0-fb.png"&gt;When we say “life begins at conception,” we’re not talking about the beginning of life in general. We’re talking about the beginning of *an individual* life. From a purely biological standpoint, fertilization creates a new, unique, tiny, living organism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/individual-vs-general-life/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_lifebegins #WMPLL_biology</description></item><item><title>We Will Support You</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/we-will-support-you/</link><guid>8df97ae4-ec24-47c0-bf41-5e03194dee81</guid><pubDate>2019-11-24</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/we-will-support-you/we-will-support-you-0-fb.png"&gt;Pro-life pregnancy resource centers provide free or low-cost goods and services, often including pregnancy tests, sonograms, maternity clothes, diapers, counseling, and education. Familiarize yourself with pregnancy resource centers in your area so that you’re prepared to help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/we-will-support-you/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_society #WMPLL_buildeachotherup</description></item><item><title>Chickens Breathe</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/chickens-breathe/</link><guid>7279c7b1-bbce-4536-9825-2fbfb9585388</guid><pubDate>2019-11-02</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/chickens-breathe/chickens-breathe-1-fb.png"&gt;This is an example of the Equal Rights Argument. On all sides of the abortion debate, most people agree that those of us outside the womb have equal value. Ask what we have in common that makes us equal, and listen carefully to the answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this example, the proposed answer is that breathing air is what makes us equal. Many non-human animals such as roosters breathe air too. This is important, because most people agree that humans and roosters are not equals. To be clear, we’re not saying that animals shouldn’t have any protections. Animal abuse is wrong. We’re just saying that humans and roosters don’t have the same exact status. So breathing can’t be what makes us equals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We think a good explanation for our equality is simply that we’re all living human organisms. A fetus is also a living human organism, so if we’re correct, then the fetus is a person with the same value as you and us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out this related collection of newsletters by Justice for All: http://doc.jfaweb.org/Training/JFAEqualRightsNewsletterCollection.pdf&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/chickens-breathe/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_personhood</description></item><item><title>Never Accept Rape</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/never-accept-rape/</link><guid>c197e004-f7c3-4ee7-b3f9-89c187d94098</guid><pubDate>2019-10-14</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/never-accept-rape/never-accept-rape-0-fb.png"&gt;Abortion, like rape, is an act of violence. With love and compassion, we should assist rape victims in nonviolent ways. For example, we should ensure that rape victims have access to counseling, and when a pregnant rape victim chooses to place her child for adoption, we should help with the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/never-accept-rape/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_rape #WMPLL_society #WMPLL_buildeachotherup</description></item><item><title>Care About People After Birth</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/care-about-people-after-birth/</link><guid>3957d2da-aee4-4869-8339-098aa3151cef</guid><pubDate>2019-10-03</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/care-about-people-after-birth/care-about-people-after-birth-1-fb.png"&gt;Faced with this accusation, some well-meaning pro-life advocates give an argument that abortion should be a higher priority than other issues.

We must take extra steps to safeguard women’s health. Pregnant women and their preborn children have equal value, and either one of them getting hurt is a tragedy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/save-everyone-from-abortion/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_womenshealth #WMPLL_politics #WMPLL_society</description></item><item><title>We Should Care for Unwanted Children</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/we-should-care-for-unwanted-children/</link><guid>deb24056-7538-472d-823a-3bae141b557a</guid><pubDate>2019-08-31</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/we-should-care-for-unwanted-children/we-should-care-for-unwanted-children-1-fb.png"&gt;We don’t want any children to grow up unloved, but we don’t think that’s reason enough to kill people who are already alive. We should work to improve their lives, not end their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don’t expect this analogy on its own to change anyone’s mind. Pro-choice people usually feel that there’s an important difference between abortion and killing a two-year-old. The point of the analogy is just to bring those differences to the surface. Listen very carefully as they explain what they feel is the crucial difference between abortion and killing a two-year-old, and go from there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They might point to something about the fetus herself. They might think abortion is similar to killing a plant or removing a tumor. In reality, abortion kills a living human person who deserves basic rights. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of the fetus herself, they might point to something about the situation the fetus and mother are in. They might think abortion is similar to unplugging a ventilator or defending yourself against an assailant. In reality, pregnancy does not give a mother permission to kill her child. In fact, it gives her and her community an even *greater* duty to protect the child, compared to their ordinary duties to typical adults.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rarely, someone might bite the bullet and say to kill the two-year-old. In this case, we recommend that you drop the abortion topic until you can reach agreement about killing two-year-olds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/we-should-care-for-unwanted-children/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_TOT #WMPLL_society</description></item><item><title>Be There For Abortion-Minded Women</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/be-there-for-abortion-minded-women/</link><guid>61181142-b84d-4cad-a16b-07ea15865e3d</guid><pubDate>2019-08-25</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/be-there-for-abortion-minded-women/be-there-for-abortion-minded-women-0-fb.png"&gt;Abortion is totally unacceptable, and your instinct might be to talk about everything wrong with it, but that’s often not the best approach. Instead, focus on the person standing in front of you and the challenges she’s facing. She’s probably afraid. Listen to her and try to understand her concerns first. Then prove to her through your kindness that you’re ready to support her through pregnancy. Be familiar with local life-affirming resources so you’re ready to thoroughly help her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although we don’t support abortion, we must support both pregnant women and post-abortive women. One way to support a pregnant woman is to persuade her to reject abortion. Tragically, though, sometimes our efforts fail. If she does get an abortion, we want her to feel safe talking to us again about abortion and her experience. Don’t turn your back on friends who have had abortions. Love them. Help them recognize the true nature of abortion. Help them heal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/be-there-for-abortion-minded-women/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_buildeachotherup</description></item></channel>
