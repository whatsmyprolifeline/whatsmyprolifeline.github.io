Your conversation partner might personally know someone who experienced a life-threatening health problem while pregnant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We find it helpful to talk about a concrete situation. One difficult situation is when a pregnant woman suffers from cancer somewhere in her reproductive system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s always wrong to *intentionally* attack the child, even for a noble goal like saving the mother’s life. However, it’s appropriate for doctors to treat the mother’s disease, even if those treatments have a risk of *unintentionally* harming the child. Thankfully, some approaches to treating pregnant cancer patients can potentially be effective while still giving the child a chance to thrive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, in some cases, it can be morally acceptable to surgically remove a pregnant cancer patient’s uterus, even if the child isn’t viable yet. Tragically, this drastic measure ends the child’s life. However, it’s helpful to think of this operation as separate from abortion, because the *purpose* of the operation is to preserve life and health, not to attack anybody. The harm the child undergoes is not what benefits the mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/mother-and-child-are-equal/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_womenshealth #WMPLL_ethics</description></item><item><title>Distance Yourself From Harmful Pro-Life Actions</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/distance-yourself-from-harmful-pro-life-actions/</link><guid>d535785a-1442-4ee7-b137-cbffb654cbd3</guid><pubDate>2019-07-01</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/distance-yourself-from-harmful-pro-life-actions/distance-yourself-from-harmful-pro-life-actions-0-fb.png"&gt;Society should treat both pregnant women and preborn children with respect. We appreciate groups like Sidewalk Advocates for Life who gently encourage women considering abortion to leave the abortion facility and instead take advantage of life-affirming resources. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abortion is completely unacceptable, but it’s not always time to make a pro-life argument. Love the person you’re talking to. Be gentle, especially if they’re upset. If they consider you to be an “enemy,” they might not be ready to think about new ideas you could present anyway. Conversations about emotionally charged topics like abortion are most productive when both parties are calm and open to new perspectives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/distance-yourself-from-harmful-pro-life-actions/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_buildeachotherup #WMPLL_empathy #WMPLL_society</description></item><item><title>Abortion vs. Not Donating Organs</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/abortion-vs-not-donating-organs/</link><guid>988a76c0-4831-4e9b-8741-ccecfa3449b3</guid><pubDate>2019-06-12</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/abortion-vs-not-donating-organs/abortion-vs-not-donating-organs-0-940.png"&gt;Some well-meaning pro-life advocates only focus on the nature of the preborn, but that’s not always helpful. Some pro-choice arguments, like the one in this example, attempt to show that abortion is okay *even if* a fetus has human rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many differences between abortion and refraining from donating an organ, but one of the most important differences is this. When a patient waiting for an organ transplant dies, *her injury or illness* is what kills her. If you could have donated the organ and didn’t, you allowed her to die, but you didn’t kill her. To be clear, this tragic situation is very serious, and we should all carefully consider whether we are doing enough to assist those in need. However, declining to donate organs is not homicide. In contrast, when a fetus dies through elective abortion, *the act of abortion itself* is what kills her. Abortion is a violation of basic human rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out this related blog post by Pro-Life Humanists: http://www.prolifehumanists.org/unwanted-pregnancy-forced-organ-donation/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/abortion-vs-not-donating-organs/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_bodilyautonomy #WMPLL_ethics</description></item><item><title>Take Pro-Choice Ideas Seriously</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/take-pro-choice-ideas-seriously/</link><guid>d0da0742-c440-4431-8b24-663b3ce5c5ce</guid><pubDate>2019-06-08</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/take-pro-choice-ideas-seriously/take-pro-choice-ideas-seriously-0-940.png"&gt;Pro-choice people are our peers. Ultimately, we think the best arguments and evidence support the pro-life position, but you should take pro-choice arguments seriously. People defending abortion deserve genuine responses to the things they say. If we all try to understand each other, we’ll be in a better position to reach a consensus about abortion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/take-pro-choice-ideas-seriously/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_buildeachotherup</description></item><item><title>Push Forward to a Pro-Life Future</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/push-forward-to-a-pro-life-future/</link><guid>d95d4b3e-2972-418c-8579-3642a39a4f0c</guid><pubDate>2019-06-01</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/push-forward-to-a-pro-life-future/push-forward-to-a-pro-life-future-0-940.png"&gt;Unfortunately, people were treated badly in the past, and people are still treated badly today.

Build common ground with your conversation partner by showing that you care about pregnant women too. As pro-life advocates, we think society should use nonviolent methods to support pregnant women. If you make that clear, your conversation partner will be more likely to take your anti-abortion stance seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/women-get-abortions-for-real-reasons/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_empathy</description></item></channel>
